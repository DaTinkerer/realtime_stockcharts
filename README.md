For this project, I wanted to learn how to use Celery and Django Channels. I used Celery to get time series data from the Twelve Data finance api which Django Channels then recieves and sends to the front end in the form of python lists which are then converted to candlestick charts using Plotly.js. I used Celery beat to periodically call the celery task so that the data is updated automatically.
